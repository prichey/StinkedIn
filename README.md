StinkedIn
=============

Chrome extension that replaces LinkedIn jargon with more honest alternatives.

This is basically just a fork of [cloud-to-butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt), but it runs after each AJAX GET request (throttled), since LinkedIn loads in nearly all of its content with AJAX.
